# Edit a VLAN Name
{:#edit-vlan-name}

Each VLAN is issued a permanent VLAN number to assist in identifying it. You also may assign a VLAN name and edit it at any time. VLAN names are displayed on the VLANs screen and also when you view the individual VLAN. We recommend using a naming convention for your VLANs, so they can be identified easily by all users on the account.

You can update the VLAN name from the **VLANs** screen or from the **VLAN Details** screen. Your changes are visible in all locations for the VLAN, regardless of which screen you use.

For either option, first go to the VLANs screen:

1. Open the [IBM Cloud console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the menu, select **Infrastructure**.
3. In the Customer Portal navigation, select **Network > IP Management > VLANs**.

To edit a VLAN name from the VLANs screen:

1. Select the **Name** cell for the desired VLAN to open the cell for edits.
2. Click anywhere on the screen to close the field for edits and save the change.

To edit a VLAN name from the VLAN Details screen:

1. Click on the VLAN to view its details.
2. Select the **Name** cell for the desired VLAN to open the cell for edits.
3. Click anywhere on the screen to close the field for edits and save the change.

## What Happens Next

After you edit the VLAN name, the field will change color briefly, indicating that your change has been saved. You may edit the VLAN name again at any time by repeating the previous steps.
